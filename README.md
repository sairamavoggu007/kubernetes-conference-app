Return values

    A function can return data as a result
    A function can return multiple values
    So a function can take an input and return an output
    In Go you have to define the input and output paramamters including its type explicitly

Exporting a variable
 Make is available for all package in the app
 Capitalize first Letter of function Name

Map is collection of key value pairs
Map unique keys to value
youc can retrive it using a key later
all keys have same data type
all values have same data type
create an empty map with "make"
using Map you can not mix data types
map supports only 1 data types


Struct
create struct using "type"
Multiple variables to collect different types of data
To save mixed data types we can "struct"
can hold multipe data types
The type keyword creates a new type, with the name you specify
"create a type called "UserData" based on a struct of firstName, lastName
In fact, you could also create a type based on every other data type like  int,string etc.


For concurrent threads we use "go ..." starts a new goroutine
A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the go runtime

synchronizing the goroutine
